Zenject: Dependency Injection Framework for Unity3D
=====================================

This project started based on [this](https://github.com/sebas77/Lightweight-IoC-Container-for-Unity3D) implementation. The following articles may be helpful:

* http://blog.sebaslab.com/ioc-container-for-unity3d-part-1/
* http://blog.sebaslab.com/ioc-container-for-unity3d-part-2/

At some point I will add some more documentation here.  For now, if you are interested in using Zenject, please refer to the Sample project which you can find [here](https://github.com/modesttree/ZenjectSample).  For an introduction on Dependency Injection Frameworks in general, I highly recommend Mark Seeman's book, "Dependency Injection in .NET".
